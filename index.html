            <p>I am new to programming, but I love it. I ran a farm business outside of Raleigh from 2012-2018. Farming was one of the most
                rewarding experiences of my life. The main reason I am swtiching careers is that I'm ready for a new challenge.
            </p>
            <p>The final project is somehting I'm very much looking forward to. My goal is to create a funcional app for small farm businesses.
                I think there is a real need for farmers to have the ability to efficiently connect with their clientelle in a way that facillitates direct sales.
