            Born and raised in Raleigh, Daniel first became interested in farming and environmental stewardship during an Outward Bound course he took in high school. Later, at Warren Wilson College in Asheville he studied sustainable agriculture and biology, and was a member of a garden crew that tended the school’s five-acre farm. After college he took a job at a plant nursery, where he worked to create a biodiesel reactor that would convert used vegetable oil into fuel for the nursery’s tractors.

Daniel’s next adventure took him overseas to rural Mali, where he enlisted in – yes – the Peace Corps for two years. As a PCV, he worked on sustainable agriculture projects. He helped women procure seeds, and taught them about composting, nutrient cycles, and natural herbicides. After the Peace Corps, Daniel traveled around Europe for three months WWOOFing – working on organic vegetable farms that provided him with room and board.

Daniel came home to North Carolina in 2010, and briefly enrolled in a master’s degree program in horticulture at NC State. But the return to academia didn’t suit him, and he decided he was ready to start a farm of his own.

Besides, there was this plot of land.
Also, I love my wife, Sarah Deasy. This is her and I on our wedding day in the picture!
